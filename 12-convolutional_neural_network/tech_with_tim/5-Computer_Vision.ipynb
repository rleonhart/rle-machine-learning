For example, an image with three channels is likely made up of rgb (red, green, blue) pixels. So, for each pixel we have three numeric values in the range 0-255 that define its color. For an image of color depth 1 we would likely have a greyscale image with one value defining each pixel, again in the range of 0-255.\n",

But this may sound familiar to what our densly connected neural network in the previous section was doing, well that's becasue it is. \n",

When we have a densly connected layer each node in that layer sees all the data from the previous layer. This means that this layer is looking at all the information and is only capable of analyzing the data in a global capacity. Our convolutional layer however will not be densly connected, this means it can detect local patterns using part of the input data to that layer.\n",

    "###How They Work\n",
    "A dense neural network learns patterns that are present in one specific area of an image. This means if a pattern that the network knows is present in a different area of the image it will have to learn the pattern again in that new area to be able to detect it. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Let's use an example to better illustrate this.*\n",

    "We'll consider that we have a dense neural network that has learned what an eye looks like from a sample of dog images.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since our densly connected network has only recognized patterns globally it will look where it thinks the eyes should be present. Clearly it does not find them there and therefore would likely determine this image is not a dog. Even though the pattern of the eyes is present, it's just in a different location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since convolutional layers learn and detect patterns from different areas of the image, they don't have problems with the example we just illustrated. They know what an eye looks like and by analyzing different parts of the image can find where it is present. \n",

These layers work together by increasing complexity and abstraction at each subsequent layer. The first layer might be responsible for picking up edges and short lines, while the second layer will take as input these lines and start forming shapes or polygons. Finally, the last layer might take these shapes and determine which combiantions make up a specific image.\n",

The number of filters in a convolutional layer reprsents how many patterns each layer is looking for and what the depth of our response map will be. If we are looking for 32 different patterns/filters than our output feature map (aka the response map) will have a depth of 32. Each one of the 32 layers of depth will be a matrix of some size containing values indicating if the filter was present at that location or not.\n",

Pooling is usually done using windows of size 2x2 and a stride of 2. This will reduce the size of the feature map by a factor of two and return a response map that is 2x smaller."

    "You would have noticed that the model above takes a few minutes to train in the NoteBook and only gives an accuaracy of ~70%. This is okay but surely there is a way to improve on this. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will talk about using a pretrained CNN as apart of our own custom network to improve the accuracy of our model. We know that CNN's alone (with no dense layers) don't do anything other than map the presence of features from our input. This means we can use a pretrained CNN, one trained on millions of images, as the start of our model. This will allow us to have a very good convolutional base before adding our own dense layered classifier at the end. In fact, by using this techique we can train a very good classifier for a realtively small dataset (< 10,000 images). This is because the convnet already has a very good idea of what features to look for in an image and can find them very effectively. So, if we can determine the presence of features all the rest of the model needs to do is determine which combination of features makes a specific image.\n",

    "###Fine Tuning\n",
    "When we employ the technique defined above, we will often want to tweak the final layers in our convolutional base to work better for our specific problem. This involves not touching or retraining the earlier layers in our convolutional base but only adjusting the final few. We do this because the first layers in our base are very good at extracting low level features lile lines and edges, things that are similar for any kind of image. Where the later layers are better at picking up very specific features like shapes or even eyes. If we adjust the final layers than we can look for only features relevant to our very specific problem.\n",
